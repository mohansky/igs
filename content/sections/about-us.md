Indo German School began its journey in 1991 in a small house in Indiranagar with five children. Over the next 15 years, the school grew and provided affordable quality education for more than thousand children from the area. In 2008 the school moved to its new campus in Kasturinagar which offers ample play space and greenery. As an early years school, we believe in inclusivity and provide a safe and nurturing environment for children. We follow the Montessori method which enhances exploration and play.

IGS was founded with the intention of providing education to all regardless of their differences. Inclusive education benefits all and is key in changing discriminatory attitudes. For a child, a school provides context to its first relationship with the world outside their families. Children learn more from each other than they do in a classroom. An environment that enables social relationships and interactions is vital in the early years of a child. Mutual respect and understanding grow when students of diverse abilities and backgrounds play, socialize, and learn together.
